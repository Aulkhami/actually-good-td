# Spring

This module was forked from [`Quenty/NevermoreEngine`](https://github.com/Quenty/NevermoreEngine/blob/main/src/spring/src/Shared/Spring.lua), so script credits goes to Quenty. This package simply adds generic typing and exported types. For documentation, visit [NevermoreEngine's API Docs](https://quenty.github.io/NevermoreEngine/api/Spring/).

To install this package with [Wally](https://github.com/UpliftGames/wally), simply add the following to your `wally.toml` file:

```toml
Spring = "murtlatif/spring@0.1.2"
```

then run `wally install`. Be sure to check out [wally package page](https://wally.run/package/murtlatif/spring) for the latest version, since this documentation may not be up to date.
